This project's goal is to become a complete open source replacement of the LiveView official application, and even extend its original capabilities at some point.

WHAT WORKS:
     * Connecting to the LiveView device via Bluetooth
     * Raw handling of the basic protocol stack: Vibrate, Led, StandBy, Screen Properties,
        Date and Time, Protocol Version, Firmware Version,
     * Basic stacking of commands

WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE:
    * Better connection handling, PNGs NDK lib, menus, plugins support, theming support, YOU NAME IT ...
