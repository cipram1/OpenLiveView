This project's goal is to become a complete open source replacement of the LiveView official application, and even extend its original capabilities at some point.

WHAT WORKS:
     * Connecting to the LiveView device via Bluetooth
     * Very raw handling of the basic protocol stack: Vibrate, Led, StandBy, Screen Properties

WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE:
    * Better connection handling, PNGs NDK lib, stack of commands, menus, plugins support, YOU NAME IT ...
